# Create a GitHub account {#sec-github-account}

To participate in the workshop, you will need a GitHub account. Please
go to the [GitHub website](github.com) and create an account. Remember
your username, as you will need it for the survey at the end of this
section.

::: callout-note
If you already have one, you can skip this task, but we will still ask
you to provide your username in the survey at the end of this section.

Whenever events or activities related to you happen on GitHub, you will
receive a notification. By default, the notification sends to both your
GitHub "inbox" (which we cover later) and your email. Unfortunately,
there can quickly become a lot of activities happening and you will
receive a large volume of email notifications. This can be overwhelming.

You can manage your notifications and prevent your email inbox from
being sent many GitHub notification emails by setting a few options in
your GitHub account settings.

While logged into your new GitHub account, click on your account icon in
the top-right corner of GitHub and select the "Settings" option. In the
left sidebar, select "Notifications". Under "Subscriptions", select
"Notify me: on GitHub" and for all options. In the "System" section,
under "Actions", deselect all options and click "Save". This will show
up as "Don't notify". If you want some notifications sent to your email,
you can always come back and change these settings later.

With these options selected, you will only get notifications on GitHub,
not by email.
