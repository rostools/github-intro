# Pre-workshop survey {#sec-pre-survey}

If you haven't read the sections under "Workshop overview" and
"Pre-workshop tasks", **please read them now**.

Also make sure to read the [Code of
Conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html), since the survey
involves a question about it. We want to make sure this workshop is a
supportive and safe environment for learning, so this is
quite important.

<!-- TODO: Add a link to the survey. -->

You're almost done. Please fill out the pre-workshop survey to finish
this section, [at this link]().

See you at the workshop! :wave:
