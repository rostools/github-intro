# Version control with Git and GitHub {#sec-git-and-github}

This reading is meant as a primer to the workshop. It will introduce you
to the concepts of *version control*, *Git*, and *GitHub* which are
central concepts of the workshop and to working with files on GitHub in
general.

## Why learn and use GitHub specifically? {#sec-why-github}

When you're learning something new, it helps to put it into a context.
While we've already covered some of this in the
[syllabus](/overview/syllabus.qmd), we haven't fully addressed probably
one of the biggest questions people may have: Why GitHub?

GitHub is an extremely popular and widely used online platform for
managing Git repositories. As you just read, Git repositories come with a
lot of features to work with files and track changes to them. But GitHub
does much more than that. It can be used for [project
management](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects),
running automatic [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) that
do tasks for you, hosting [websites](https://docs.github.com/en/pages),
and
[collaborating](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
with others, for example by reviewing each other's work. GitHub also
allows you to create tasks or notes (known as [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/features/issues)) that are connected to your
project's repository. We'll create our own GitHub Issues later in this
workshop.

While there are other platforms that do similar things, such as
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
GitHub is more widely used than the others and has a much larger
community. So you will be able to find many different resources, tools,
and projects on GitHub that you can use and learn from.

More and more researchers are using GitHub to do their research,
collaborate with others, and share their work. It is an extremely
effective and powerful way to collaborate. And because GitHub is
extensively indexed by search engines, as well as having its own search
engine, it is also a very effective way of making it easier for other
researchers to discover your work and research. It is a great way to
share your research and make it more [open and
accessible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research).

In order to remain relevant and connected to the current and future
research community, we need to embrace and use tools that improve how we
do our work and how we disseminate our research. And GitHub is one of
these tools.

So in that context, this workshop is designed as a gentle introduction
to using GitHub to manage your files related to your research and work.
Before diving into some of the more advanced uses, it's important to
understand the basics of how GitHub works and how to use it effectively.
In this workshop, our focus is to cover the most fundamental and
important features of GitHub that will help you get started with using
it for your own work.

## Summary of Git and GitHub

-   Using a *formal version control* system like Git can help you keep
    track of changes to your files and projects.
-   A Git *repository* is a place where you store all the files for your
    project along with their history.
-   GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories, allowing you to
    store and share your files and projects online.
-   Through GitHub you can manage your files and projects using Git.
