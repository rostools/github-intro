# Overview {#sec-pre-workshop}

In order to participate in this workshop, you must complete everything
in this section and finish with **completing the
[survey](/pre-workshop/pre-survey.qmd)** at the end. These tasks are meant to provide everyone with the necessary setup and a shared foundation for the workshop.

Depending on your prior knowledge and skills, these tasks could take between
**1-2 hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning some time to complete
them. While many of the tasks are mostly readings, they are important in
making sure you get the most out of the workshop.

## Summary of tasks

Here's a quick overview of the tasks you need to do. Specific details
about them are found as you work through the tasks.

If you haven't already, go through the workshop overview section,
including the [Syllabus](/overview/syllabus.qmd), [Is this for
you?](/overview/is-it-for-you.qmd), and [Learning
design](/overview/learning-design.qmd) to get an overview of what this
workshop contains and the learning design behind the workshop material.

    GitHub](/pre-workshop/git-and-github.qmd),
