Start the workshop by introducing yourself and the helpers. Then briefly
introduce the workshop by going through the
[schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd).

## Workshop details

## :teacher: Teacher note

Briefly review the learning design, reinforcing why we do each activity.
Especially highlight the use of the stickies/hats.
:::

Before we get started, let's go over some of the details of the
workshop, which will help orient you to the workshop structure and what
to expect:

-   We do "type-alongs" where the teacher types and actually shows how
    things are done and explains what they are doing and why, while you
    type along.

-   Reading activities are used to give you time to think and process in
    your own way. After the reading, the teacher repeats and rephrases
    the key points to reinforce the concepts you just read.

-   We use "stickies" or origami hats to assess how everyone is doing
    and for you to request help if you get stuck. When the "help"
    sticky/origami hat is up, a helper will come by and help you out.

-   The [schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd) is a *guide* only, some
    sessions are longer, others shorter. It is not intended to be firm
    or strict.

-   We seek out and use feedback to improve the workshops. At the end of
    the workshop, you will be asked to fill out an online survey and
    give your feedback on it. We really want and need honest,
    constructive feedback to improve things! While you are a participant
    of the workshop, you are also a collaborator and "tester" of the
    material. Every time we run a workshop, there are always things to
    improve on and your feedback helps us identify those things.

## A reminder: The big picture

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Verbally and briefly go over this section, to remind the learners about
the reason and purpose of this workshop.
:::

As you read about in the pre-workshop tasks, GitHub is an increasingly
common tool that researchers use. You will likely encounter it in some
way as you do your work, either through collaborators or when reading
literature. As research becomes increasingly more dependent on
integrated digital tools and workflows, it is essential to be familiar
with these tools in order to be effective in present day research.

This workshop aims to get you more familiar with GitHub to help you get
started with using it in your own work. During this workshop, we'll
create a Git repository on GitHub with a recipe book, adding,
organising, and editing text files with recipes :cake: :pancakes:
:cookie:

This is meant to be a fun and light-hearted project that will help you
learn the basics of Git and GitHub.

1.  During the first session, [The Basics of Git and
    GitHub](/sessions/basics.qmd), we will go through the basics of Git
    and GitHub. This is a more conceptual, reading-heavy session, where
    we will learn about the concepts of Git and GitHub. We will also
    learn about the difference between Git and GitHub, and how they work
    together.

2.  Then, in the next session, [Creating a repository on
    GitHub](/sessions/create-repo.qmd), we will navigate the GitHub
    landing page and create a new repository.

3.  Then, in the third session, [Working with files on
    GitHub](/sessions/working-with-files.qmd), we will learn how to work
    with files in Git and GitHub, including how to add, edit, and delete
    files and folders.

4.  Finally, in the last session on [GitHub
    Issues](/sessions/using-issues.qmd), we will use GitHub
    Issues to track tasks and discussions, and how to assign and tag
    people in issues.
