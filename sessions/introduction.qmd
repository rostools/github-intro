Start the workshop by introducing yourself and the helpers. Then
briefly introduce the workshop by going through the
[schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd).

Review the learning design, reinforcing why we do each activity.
Especially highlight the use of the stickies/hats.

Before we get started, let's go over some of the details of the
workshop, which will help orient you to the workshop structure and what
to expect:

-   We do "type-alongs" where the teacher types and actually shows how
    things are done and explains what they are doing and why, while you
    type along.

-   Reading activities are used to give you time to think and process in
    your own way. After the reading, the teacher repeats and rephrases
    the key points to reinforce the concepts you just read.

-   We use "stickies" or origami hats to assess how everyone is doing
    and for you to request help if you get stuck. When the "help"
    sticky/origami hat is up, a helper will come by and help you out.

-   The [schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd) is a *guide* only, some
    sessions are longer, others shorter. It is not intended to be firm
    or strict.

-   We seek out and use feedback to improve the workshops. At the end of
    the workshop, you will be asked to fill out an online survey and
    give your feedback on it. We really want and need honest,
    constructive feedback to improve things! While you are a participant
    of the workshop, you are also a collaborator and "tester" of the
    material. Every time we run a workshop, there are always things to
    improve on and your feedback help us identify those things.

## :book: Reading task: The big picture

**Time: \~5 minutes.**

When you're learning something new, it helps to put it into a context.
While we've already covered some of this in the
[syllabus](/overview/syllabus.qmd), we haven't fully addressed probably
one of the biggest questions people may have: **Why learn and use GitHub
specifically?**

GitHub is an extremely popular and widely used online platform for
managing Git repositories. And, as we saw in the [pre-workshop
tasks](/pre-workshop/git-and-github.qmd), Git repositories come with a
lot of features to work with files and track changes to them. But GitHub
does much more than that. It can be used for [project
management](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects),
running automatic [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) that
do tasks for you, hosting [websites](https://docs.github.com/en/pages),
and
[collaborating](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
with others, for example by reviewing each others work. GitHub also
allows you to create tasks or notes (known as [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/features/issues)) that are connected to your
project's repository. We'll create our own GitHub Issues later in this
workshop.

While there are other platforms that do similar things, such as
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
GitHub is more widely used than the others and has a much larger
community. So you will be able to find many different resources, tools,
and projects on GitHub that you can use and learn from.

More and more researchers are using GitHub to do their research,
collaborate with others, and share their work. It is an extremely
effective and powerful way to collaborate. And because GitHub is
extensively indexed by search engines, as well as having its own search
engine, it is also a very effective way of making it easier for other
researchers to discover your work and research. It is a great way to
share your research and make it more [open and
accessible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research).

In order to remain relevant and connected to the current and future
research community, we need to embrace and use tools that improve how we
do our work and how we disseminate our research. And GitHub is one of
these tools.

So in that context, this workshop is designed as a gentle introduction
to using GitHub to manage your files related to your research and work.
Before diving into some of the more advanced uses, it's important to
understand the basics of how GitHub works and how to use it effectively.
In this workshop, our focus is to cover the most fundamental and
important features of GitHub that will help you get started with using
it for your own work.
