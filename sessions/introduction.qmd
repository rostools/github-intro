Start the workshop by introducing yourself and the helpers. Then briefly
introduce the workshop by going through the
[schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd).

Briefly review the learning design, reinforcing why we do each activity.
Especially highlight the use of the stickies/hats.

Before we get started, let's go over some of the details of the
workshop, which will help orient you to the workshop structure and what
to expect. We've already covered a lot of these things in detail in
[learning design](/overview/learning-design.qmd), so this is mostly a
brief reminder.

-   We do **"type-alongs" or "code-alongs"** where the teacher types and
    shows how to do things and explains what they are doing and why,
    while you type along.

-   **Reading tasks** are used to give you time to think and process at
    your own pace. After the reading task, the teacher repeats and
    rephrases the key points to reinforce the concepts you just read.

-   **Discussion activities** are used to reflect on the workshop
    content and give you a chance to talk to your peers about the
    concepts.

-   We use **"stickies", origami hats, or other visual indicators** to
    assess how everyone is doing and for you to request help if you get
    stuck. When the "help" sticky/origami hat/indicator is up, a helper
    will come by as soon as they are available and help you out.

-   The [**schedule**](/overview/schedule.qmd) **is a *guide* only**,
    some sessions might be longer, others shorter. It is not intended to
    be firm or strict.

-   We depend on and want **honest, constructive, and critical
    feedback** to improve the workshops. At the end of the workshop, you
    will fill out a survey to get your feedback. While you are a
    participant, you are also a "collaborator" and "tester". There are
    always things to improve on and your feedback helps us identify
    those things.

## A reminder: The big picture

Verbally and briefly go over this section, to remind the learners about
the reason and purpose of this workshop.
:::

As you read about in the pre-workshop tasks, GitHub is an increasingly
common tool that researchers use. You will likely encounter it in some
way as you do your work, either through collaborators or when reading
literature. As research becomes increasingly more dependent on
integrated digital tools and workflows, it is essential to be familiar
with these tools in order to be effective in present day research.

This workshop aims to get you more familiar with GitHub to help you get
started with using it in your own work. During this workshop, we'll
create a Git repository on GitHub with a recipe book, adding,
organising, and editing text files with recipes :cake: :pancakes:
:cookie:

This is meant to be a fun and light-hearted project that will help you
learn the basics of Git and GitHub.

1.  During the first session, [The Basics of Git and
    GitHub](/sessions/basics.qmd), we will go through the basics of Git
    and GitHub. This is a more conceptual, reading-heavy session, where
    we will learn about the concepts of Git and GitHub. We will also
    learn about the difference between Git and GitHub, and how they work
    together.

2.  Then, in the next session, [Creating a repository on
    GitHub](/sessions/create-repo.qmd), we will navigate the GitHub
    landing page and create a new repository.

3.  Then, in the third session, [Working with files on
    GitHub](/sessions/working-with-files.qmd), we will learn how to work
    with files in Git and GitHub, including how to add, and edit files
    and folders.

4.  Finally, in the last session on [GitHub
    Issues](/sessions/using-issues.qmd), we will use GitHub Issues to
    track tasks and discussions, and how to assign and tag people in
    issues.
