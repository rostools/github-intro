## Creating an Issue

Since that we've decided that our recipe book should only include
recipes for sweets and baked goods, we might want to add a new folder
for sweets in the future, such as recipes for chocolate-covered
strawberries or chocolate mousse. Let's create an Issue to keep track of
this task.

In the repository, we'll click on the "Issues" tab. On this page, we'll
see a list of the open issues in our repository. Since we (or someone
else) haven't added an issue yet, this list is empty. We will create a
new Issue by clicking the "New issue" button in the top-right side of
the page. Let's give the Issue the title "Add a folder for sweets" and
write that we want to add a new folder for sweets in the description.
Since this is a very simple task, the description doesn't add much new
information, but it's good practice to write a description that explains
the task in more detail.

We can also assign someone to the issue so it is visible that they are
responsible for completing this task. Since we don't have any
collaborators on the project yet, let's assign it to ourselves. We can
achieve this by going to the "Assignees" section on the right side of
the page and click on our username.

Finally, we can click the "Create issue" button in the bottom right side
of the page to create the Issue.

Once we've created the Issue, we can click the "Issues" tab to see it in
the list of Issues in the repository. We can click on the Issue to see
more details, such as comments, and we can also close the Issue once the
task is completed.

We have now created our first Issue :tada:!

## :technologist: Exercise: Create an issue with a list of future recipes to add

**Time: \~10 minutes**

To help you keep track of future tasks, you can use GitHub Issues. Let's
make an Issue with a list of recipes you want to add to your repository.

1.  In your repository, click the "Issues" tab.

2.  Click the green "New issue" button.

3.  Fill in the title with text like "List of future recipes". Then fill
    in the description box with some recipes you would like to add. If
    you don't know any recipes or are not sure, you could write:

    ``` markdown
    I want to add the following recipes to the recipe book:

    -   Pancakes
    -   Apple pie
    ```

4.  Click the green "Create" button to create the issue.

You now have an issue to remind yourself of recipes you want to add!
:tada:

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Comment on your neighbour's issue with a recipe suggestion

**Time: \~10 minutes**

One of the great things about GitHub is that it makes it easier to
collaborate with others. So, interact with someone else's issue by
adding a comment to it:

1.  With your neighbour one at a time, go to each other's GitHub
    repository.
2.  Go to the "Issues" tab in their repository.
3.  Click on the issue that they have created with the list of future
    recipes.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a comment in the
    comment field suggesting a recipe that they could add to their
    recipe book. For example, you could suggest that they add a brownie
    recipe as well :cake:.
5.  When you have written your comment, click the green "Comment" button
    to post the comment.

## Add a collaborator to your repository

<!-- TODO: Add context to this code along -->

In your repository, click "Settings", then "Collaborators and teams",
and then "Add people". Add your neighbour as a collaborator to your
repository.

## :technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe to your neighbour's repository

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now, you'll add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we've done during this workshop, add a new file with a recipe,
    naming the file by using the recipe name (remember the correct
    naming for files!). This time, you will be adding the file to your
    neighbour's repository. In the file, add a recipe of your choice.
    For convenience, you can also use the brownie recipe below.

3.  Commit the changes as you have done previously in the workshop. Then
    go to the neighbour's repository's history to see the changes you
    have made.

**Example brownie recipe:**

``` markdown
Ingredients for brownies

- 350 grams dark chocolate
- 250 grams butter
- 4 eggs
- 150 grams brown sugar
- 150 grams white sugar
- 60 grams flour
- 1 tsp baking powder

Instructions

1. Melt the chocolate and butter together.
2. Whisk the eggs until frothy and add brown and white sugar.
3. Add the melted chocolate and butter to the egg mixture.
4. Add the flour and baking powder.
5. Pour the mixture into a baking tray and bake at 170Â°C for 30-35 minutes.
```

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Consider advantages to Issues in your own work

**Time: \~4 minutes.**

To connect what we've learned to your own daily work, consider what
advantages (and barriers) there are to using Issues in your own work.

1.  Take \~1 minute to think how you would integrate Issues into your
    work and what advantages and challenges there may be.
2.  Pair up with your neighbour, and take 1.5 minutes each to share what
    you've thought about.
