## :technologist: Exercise: Create an issue to discuss future recipes

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Imagine that you would like to discuss or brainstorm some ideas on
what recipes to add to your recipe book next. Since GitHub Issues can be
used for exactly that, it makes sense to create one to keep track of
these ideas:

1.  In your repository, click the "Issues" tab, and then the "New issue"
    button.

2.  Fill in the title with text like "What recipes to add next?". Then
    fill in the description box with some recipes you might want to add
    in the future. If you don't know any recipes or are not sure, you
    could write something like:

    ``` markdown
    In the future I want to add more recipes to this project, but I'm not
    entirely sure what to add yet. I'm open to suggestions!

    Maybe, it could be:

    -   Chocolate mousse
    -   Chocolate-covered strawberries
    -   Apple pie
    ```

3.  To inform the person you would like to get suggestions from, you can
    tag them in the issue. To do this, type `@` followed by the username
    of the person you want to tag. For example, if you want to tag
    someone with the user name `signekb`, you would type `@signekb`. Ask
    your neighbour about their GitHub username and tag them in the
    issue. You could write: "Hey \@\[neighbour's GitHub username\], what
    do you think about the recipes I've listed here? Do you have any
    other suggestions?"

4.  When you have added a title and description to the issue as well as tagged
    your neighbour in it, click the "Create" button to create it.

You now have an issue to remind yourself of recipes you want to add!

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Comment on your neighbour's issue with a recipe suggestion

**Time: \~10 minutes**

One of the great things about GitHub is that it makes it easier to
collaborate with others. So, interact with someone else's issue by
adding a comment to it:

1.  With your neighbour one at a time, go to each other's GitHub
    repository.
2.  Go to the "Issues" tab in their repository.
3.  Click on the issue that they have created with the list of future
    recipes.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a comment in the
    comment field suggesting a recipe that they could add to their
    recipe book. For example, you could suggest that they add a brownie
    recipe as well :cake:.
5.  When you have written your comment, click the green "Comment" button
    to post the comment.

## Add a collaborator to your repository

<!-- TODO: Add context to this code along -->

In your repository, click "Settings", then "Collaborators and teams",
and then "Add people". Add your neighbour as a collaborator to your
repository.

## :technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe to your neighbour's repository

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now, you'll add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we've done during this workshop, add a new file with a recipe,
    naming the file by using the recipe name (remember the correct
    naming for files!). This time, you will be adding the file to your
    neighbour's repository. In the file, add a recipe of your choice.
    For convenience, you can also use the brownie recipe below.

3.  Commit the changes as you have done previously in the workshop. Then
    go to the neighbour's repository's history to see the changes you
    have made.

**Example brownie recipe:**

``` markdown
Ingredients for brownies

- 350 grams dark chocolate
- 250 grams butter
- 4 eggs
- 150 grams brown sugar
- 150 grams white sugar
- 60 grams flour
- 1 tsp baking powder

Instructions

1. Melt the chocolate and butter together.
2. Whisk the eggs until frothy and add brown and white sugar.
3. Add the melted chocolate and butter to the egg mixture.
4. Add the flour and baking powder.
5. Pour the mixture into a baking tray and bake at 170Â°C for 30-35 minutes.
```

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Consider advantages to Issues in your own work

**Time: \~4 minutes.**

To connect what we've learned to your own daily work, consider what
advantages (and barriers) there are to using Issues in your own work.

1.  Take \~1 minute to think how you would integrate Issues into your
    work and what advantages and challenges there may be.
2.  Pair up with your neighbour, and take 1.5 minutes each to share what
    you've thought about.
