## :technologist: Exercise: Create an issue with a list of future recipes to add

**Time: \~10 minutes**

To help you keep track of future tasks, you can use GitHub Issues. Let's
make an Issue with a list of recipes you want to add to your repository.

1.  In your repository, click the "Issues" tab.

2.  Click the green "New issue" button.

3.  Fill in the title with text like "List of future recipes". Then fill
    in the description box with some recipes you would like to add. If
    you don't know any recipes or are not sure, you could write:

    ``` markdown
    I want to add the following recipes to the recipe book:

    -   Pancakes
    -   Apple pie
    ```

4.  Click the green "Create" button to create the issue.

You now have an issue to remind yourself of recipes you want to add!

## GitHub notifications

TODO: Add an instructor note here to talk about how to walk through notification tab.

Now that you've been tagged in your neighbour's issue, you will have
received a notification on GitHub (and probably also an email).

To see the notification, we'll click on the notification button with the
inbox icon in the top right corner of the GitHub page. This will show a
list of your notifications, including the one from your neighbour's
issue.

Let's take a moment to look at the information in this notification. We
can see the title of the issue, who created it, and the repository it's
in. We can also see that we've been mentioned in this issue.

If we click on the notification, it will take us to the issue page. Here
we can see the issue title, description, and comments.

Since you've been tagged in your neighbour's issue, finding the issue is
easy. You can go to the notifications by clicking the button in the top
right corner on GitHub and click on the issue to see the details.

However, if you hadn't been tagged, you couldn't find the issue this
way. So, let's practice finding the issue in your neighbour's
repository.

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Comment on your neighbour's issue with a recipe suggestion

**Time: \~10 minutes**

One of the great things about GitHub is that it makes it easier to
collaborate with others. So, interact with someone else's issue by
adding a comment to it:

1.  With your neighbour one at a time, go to each other's GitHub
    repository.
2.  Go to the "Issues" tab in their repository.
3.  Click on the issue that they have created with the list of future
    recipes.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a comment in the
    comment field suggesting a recipe that they could add to their
    recipe book. For example, you could suggest that they add a brownie
    recipe as well :cake:.
5.  When you have written your comment, click the green "Comment" button
    to post the comment.

## Add a collaborator to your repository

<!-- TODO: Add context to this code along -->

In your repository, click "Settings", then "Collaborators and teams",
and then "Add people". Add your neighbour as a collaborator to your
repository.

## :technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe to your neighbour's repository

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now, you'll add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we've done during this workshop, add a new file with a recipe,
    naming the file by using the recipe name (remember the correct
    naming for files!). This time, you will be adding the file to your
    neighbour's repository. In the file, add a recipe of your choice.
    For convenience, you can also use the brownie recipe below.

3.  Commit the changes as you have done previously in the workshop. Then
    go to the neighbour's repository's history to see the changes you
    have made.

**Example brownie recipe:**

``` markdown
Ingredients for brownies

- 350 grams dark chocolate
- 250 grams butter
- 4 eggs
- 150 grams brown sugar
- 150 grams white sugar
- 60 grams flour
- 1 tsp baking powder

Instructions

1. Melt the chocolate and butter together.
2. Whisk the eggs until frothy and add brown and white sugar.
3. Add the melted chocolate and butter to the egg mixture.
4. Add the flour and baking powder.
5. Pour the mixture into a baking tray and bake at 170Â°C for 30-35 minutes.
```

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Consider advantages to Issues in your own work

**Time: \~4 minutes.**

To connect what we've learned to your own daily work, consider what
advantages (and barriers) there are to using Issues in your own work.

1.  Take \~1 minute to think how you would integrate Issues into your
    work and what advantages and challenges there may be.
2.  Pair up with your neighbour, and take 1.5 minutes each to share what
    you've thought about.
