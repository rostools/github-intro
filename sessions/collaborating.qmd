# Collaborating on GitHub

## Learning objectives

The learning objectives of this session are:

{{< include /includes/_collaborating-objectives.qmd >}}

Right now, your repository file structure looks like this:

```
recipe-book/
├── baked-goods/
│   └── chocolate-chip-cookies.md
```

By the end of the session, your repository file structure will look like
this:

```         
recipe-book/
├── baked-goods/
│   └── chocolate-chip-cookies.md
├── desserts/ <-- Added by another person!
│   └── chocolate-mousse.md <-- Added by another person!
```

## :book: Reading task: Repository collaborators

**Time: \~4 minutes.**

We've mentioned that working on GitHub can ease collaboration. But so
far, we've only worked on our own repositories.

By default, you can't make changes to files in someone else's repository
directly even though you can see it on GitHub. If you want to work
together with someone on a project, you can add them as a
**collaborator** to your repository. This way, they can make changes to
your repository as well. This mechanism ensures that only people you
have agreed to work with can make changes to files in your repository.
Nice, right?

When you've added someone as a collaborator to your repository--or they
have added you--you can work in each other's repositories much like
we've done in this workshop so far: You can add files, edit files, and
delete files.

::: callout-note
Collaborating by adding collaborators and working with files in others'
repositories is quite a simple way of collaborating on a project. It's a
good starting point for collaboration on GitHub, however, working with
Git and GitHub includes many more ways of collaborating. Collaborating
this way is a bit more technical and, unfortunately, we don't have the
time to cover it in this workshop.

But, working with collaborators and files in others' repositories is a
great starting point!

Next, we'll go through the steps to add collaborators to your
repositories :tada:

## :technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe to your neighbour's repository

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now, you'll add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we've done during this workshop, add a new file with a recipe,
    naming the file by using the recipe name (remember the correct
    naming for files!). This time, you will be adding the file to your
    neighbour's repository. In the file, add a recipe of your choice.
    For convenience, you can also use the brownie recipe below.

3.  Commit the changes as you have done previously in the workshop. Then
    go to the neighbour's repository's history to see the changes you
    have made.

**Example brownie recipe:**

``` markdown
