# Collaborating on GitHub

## Learning objectives

The learning objectives of this session are:

{{< include /includes/_collaborating-objectives.qmd >}}

Right now, your repository file structure looks like this:

```
recipe-book/
├── baked-goods/
│   └── chocolate-chip-cookies.md
```

By the end of the session, your repository file structure will look like
this:

```         
recipe-book/
├── baked-goods/
│   └── chocolate-chip-cookies.md
├── desserts/ <-- Added by another person!
│   └── chocolate-mousse.md <-- Added by another person!
```

## Add a collaborator to your repository

<!-- TODO: Add context to this code along -->

In your repository, click "Settings", then "Collaborators and teams",
and then "Add people". Add your neighbour as a collaborator to your
repository.

## :technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe to your neighbour's repository

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now, you'll add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we've done during this workshop, add a new file with a recipe,
    naming the file by using the recipe name (remember the correct
    naming for files!). This time, you will be adding the file to your
    neighbour's repository. In the file, add a recipe of your choice.
    For convenience, you can also use the brownie recipe below.

3.  Commit the changes as you have done previously in the workshop. Then
    go to the neighbour's repository's history to see the changes you
    have made.

**Example brownie recipe:**
