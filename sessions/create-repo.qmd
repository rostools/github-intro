# Creating a repository on GitHub {#sec-create-repo}

<!-- TODO: Add an introduction here -->

## Learning objectives

The learning objectives of this session are to:

{{< include /includes/objectives/_create-repo.qmd >}}

## GitHub's landing page

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

During this section, visually show and walk through the different parts
of the landing page. You don't need to go into the pages just yet
though.

Now that we've covered some of the basics of what Git and GitHub are,
let's do some practical activities on GitHub. First, we'll start by
looking at GitHub's landing page. This is the page you see when you
first log in to GitHub. It shows you a summary of what's happening in
your GitHub account as well as quick links to common items. For this
workshop, we will only focus on these items:

-   **Top repositories** list and search bar at the top of the left
    sidebar. Since you are new to GitHub, you likely won't have any (or
    only a few) repositories listed here. When you start to work with
    more repositories, this is a quick way to access them.
-   **Create new...** button on the navigation bar on the top right that
    looks like: {{< fa plus >}} {{< fa caret-down >}}. This is where you
    can create a new repository, as well as other items we won't cover
    in this workshop.
-   **Issues** button on the navigation bar on the top right that looks
    like: {{< var issues-icon >}}. This is where you can view all issues
    you've made, participate in, or have been assigned to. From our
    experience, we don't use this item often, but it can be useful to
    quickly find or search for issues related to your work.
-   **Notifications inbox** button on navigation bar on the top right
    that looks like: {{< var inbox-icon >}}. This is where you can see
    all notifications about activities in your repositories, like when
    someone comments on an issue you made or mentions you in an issue.

We'll return to these items later in the workshop, but for now, it's
enough for you to know where they are. Letâ€™s go to the next section and
create a new repository :rocket:

## Creating a new repository

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Take it slow here as you create the repository since this is the first
"type-along" of the workshop. Make sure to explain each option and what
it does, using the table below as a guide.

Also briefly introduce Markdown and mention the `.md` file extension.
:::

Now that we've gone over the landing page of GitHub and taken a look at
some commonly used areas of GitHub, let's create a new repository on
GitHub. This is where we will store all the files and folders for the
project we will be working on in this workshop.

For this workshop, we'll create a repository for a recipe project that
will contain files with recipes :yum: :cake: :pizza: :stew:

1.  Click on the **Create new...** button {{< fa plus >}}
    {{< fa caret-down >}} on the top right side of the navigation bar.
2.  Click on the **New repository** option in the dropdown menu.
3.  A new page will open up that now shows a list of options to check
    and text boxes to fill in. @tbl-new-repo-options describes what each
    option is and what to set it as for this workshop.

| Option | Description | Workshop Setting |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------|:------------------|
| Repository owner | This is the account you are creating the repository under. If you are part of an organisation, you can also create new repositories there. | Leave it as your own personal account. |
| Repository name | This is the name of the repository or project. | Name it `recipes`. |
| Description | This is a short description of what the repository is for and what it will contain. | Write "This is a practice repository for an introductory GitHub workshop. It includes a few recipes.". |
| Public or Private | This is whether the repository is visible to everyone (public) or only to you and people you give access to (private). | Leave it as public. |
| Add a README file | This is a file that is shown on the front page of the repository. It is a good place to put information about the repository. When checked, it will say something about "set main as default branch". You can safely ignore this message. | Make sure it is checked. |
| Add .gitignore | This is a file that tells Git to ignore certain files or folders. | Leave it unchecked. |
| Choose a license | This is a file that tells others how they can use the files in the repository. | Leave it unchecked. |

: List of options available to set when creating a new repository on
GitHub. {#tbl-new-repo-options}

It's now time to click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of
the page. After you click the button, you'll be taken to the front page
of the repository. This is where you can see all the files and folders
that are currently in this repository.

In this new repository there is only one file: `README.md`. The
`README.md` file is a common file included in repositories to describe
what the repository contains and is used for.

The files that have the file extension `.md` (like this `README.md`
file) are Markdown files.
[Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) is a
plain text file format (a type of file, like Word's `.docx`) that's
designed to be easy to write and read. Markdown files are commonly used
to write text documents. We won't cover how to write Markdown in this
workshop, we'll only use them.

We will start to add and modify files in the repository in the next
session.

## A repositories' front page

Walk through the different parts, explaining as you go.
:::

After creating a new repository, we're taken to the repository's front
page. This is where we can see all the files and folders in the
repository. On the top navigation bar, there are several items, but only
two that we will focus on in this workshop:

-   **\<\> Code** tab: This is where we can see all the files and
    folders in the repository. This is the default tab that is shown
    when you go to a repository.
-   {{< var issues-icon >}} **Issues** tab: This is where we can see all
    the issues related to the repository.

In the files and folders area, there is a "table" style layout with a
"header" that contains the most recent "commit" (we'll cover that later)
with a "commit" icon on the right-hand side that links to the history
(that we will also cover later). This table has "columns" for files or
folders, the commit message relevant to changes made in that particular
file or folder, and the time when that change was made. Below this file
and folder table area is a display of the `README.md` file that was
automatically created when we created the repository. GitHub will always
by default display the contents of a `README.md` file if one exists.

This is the most we will explain and cover about the landing page in
this workshop, as they are the most important and commonly used items.

## :technologist: Exercise: Create another repository

**Time: \~3 minutes.**

To practice making repositories, create another one on your own:

1.  Go through the same steps as before to create a new repository.
2.  Name the repository something like "learning-github".
3.  Test out other settings, such as setting the repository to "private"
    and adding a `.gitignore` file.

## Summary

-   GitHub's landing page as well as its navigation bar has several
    quick links to commonly used areas of GitHub (such as the "Create
    new" button, notifications inbox and issues)
-   Create a new repository by clicking the **Create new...** button
    {{< fa plus >}} {{< fa caret-down >}} on the top right side of the
    navigation bar.
-   A repository's front page shows all the files and folders in the
    repository as well as a display of the `README.md` file if one
    exists.
