## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Add a cookie recipe to your repository

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Let's add the first recipe to your repository: A cookie recipe! :cookie:

First, we want to add a file that will include the recipe to your
repository.

1.  In the "Code" tab of your repository, click "Add file" and then "Create new file".
1.  In the "Name your file..." field, type a name for your file. Let's
    call it "cooke-recipe.md". Remember the ".md" file extension so we
    create a [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
    file.
1.  Add a cookie recipe to the file by either finding one online or using the example recipe below (inspired by
    [this](https://twin-food.dk/mit-bud-pa-de-bedste-cookies/) recipe---which is really good by the way :yum:):

    ``` markdown
    # Chocolate chip cookies

    ## Ingredients

    - 240 grams flour
    - 3/4 tsp salt
    - 140 grams butter
    - 145 grams brown sugar
    - 115 grams sugar
    - 1 1/2 tsp vanilla powder
    - 1 egg
    - 1/2 tsp baking soda
    - 1 tsp baking powder
    - 150 grams chocolate (e.g., a mix of dark and milk chocolate)
    - 100 grams chopped hazelnuts (can be omitted or replaced with oats)

    ## Instructions

    1. Mix the sugar, brown sugar, and butter well.
    2. Add the egg and mix again.
    3. Add salt, baking powder, vanilla powder, baking soda, and flour.
    4. Add the chopped chocolate and nuts.
    5. Form clumps of dough on a baking tray with plenty of space
        between them.
    6. Bake at 175°C (top and bottom heat) for 16.5-17 minutes.
    7. Once baked, transfer the baking paper with the cookies onto a
        wire rack and let them cool for 10 minutes before removing them
        from the paper.
    ```

1.  Click the green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit
    message. For example, "Add cooke recipe". You don't need
    to fill in the extended description. Keep the "Commit directly to
    the `main` branch" option selected.
1.  When you have filled in the commit message, click the green "Commit
    changes" button.
1.  Go back to your repository and check that your file has been added.

You have now added your first recipe and made your first commit to your
repository! :tada:

## :technologist: Exercise: Rename and move the `cookie-recipe.md` file

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Just like we did with our soup recipe above, let's rename the 
`cookie-recipe.md` file so the name is more specific and move it 
to a new baked goods folder. That way, if you want to
add other recipes for baked goods, you can put it in that
folder.

While you can move and rename in the same step, for practice, 
rename the file first before moving it to another folder:
Start by renaming the `cookie-recipe.md` file:

1.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") to edit the `cookie-recipe.md` file.
3.  Click the name of the file at the top of the screen and rename the
    file to `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Remember to not use spaces in the
    file name and keep the file extension (`.md`).
4.  Commit the changes as we have done it previously, by clicking the
    green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit message.

Next, move the file to a new `baked-goods/` folder in your repository:

1.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") as we did before on the `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` file.
3.  Click the name of the file at the top of the screen and change the path
    of the file to a new folder in your repository. The current file path is
    `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. To create a new folder, change the file path by typing `baked-goods/` at the start of the file name.
    Notice the `/` between the
    folder name and the file name.
4.  Commit the changes.

You have now renamed your recipe file and moved it to a new folder in
your repository! :partying_face:

## :technologist: Exercise: Create an issue with a list of future recipes to add

**Time: \~10 minutes**

You may or may not want to make a to-do list of other recipes to
add to the repository. Assuming you do want to, you can use GitHub
Issues to keep track of the recipes you want to add. Time to make one!

1.  In your repository, click the "Issues" tab.
2.  Click the green "New issue" button.
3.  Fill in the title with text like "List of future recipes".
    Then fill in the description box with some recipes you
    would like to add. If you don't know any recipes or are 
    not sure, you could write:
    
    ``` markdown
    I want to add the following recipes to the recipe book:
    
    -   Pancakes
    -   Apple pie
    ```
4.  Click the green "Create" button to create the issue.

You now have an issue to remind yourself of recipes to add! :tada:

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Comment with a recipe suggestion to your neighbour's issue

**Time: \~10 minutes**

One of the great things about GitHub is that it makes it easier to
collaborate with others. So, interact with someone else's issue by adding a comment to it:

1.  One at a time, go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.
2.  Go to the "Issues" tab in their repository.
3.  Click on the issue that they have created with the list of future
    recipes.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a comment in the
    comment field suggesting a recipe that they could add to their
    recipe book. For example, you could suggest that they add a brownie
    recipe as well :cake:.
5.  When you have written your comment, click the green "Comment" button
    to post the comment.

> Time: \~10 minutes.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Instructor note

Before starting this exercise, make sure that the learners have added
their neighbour as collaborators to their repositories. If they haven't,
they can do so by going to the repository, clicking on "Settings", then
"Collaborators and teams", and then "Add people".
:::

Now, let's add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we've done during this workshop, add
    a new file with a recipe, naming the file by using the recipe name (remember the correct naming for files!). 
    This time, you will be adding the file to your 
    neighbour's repository. In the file, add a recipe of your choice.
    For convenience, you can also use the brownie recipe below:

    ``` markdown
    # Brownies

    ## Ingredients 

    - 350 grams dark chocolate
    - 250 grams butter
    - 4 eggs
    - 150 grams brown sugar
    - 150 grams white sugar
    - 60 grams flour
    - 1 tsp baking powder

    ## Instructions

    1. Melt the chocolate and butter together.
    2. Whisk the eggs until frothy and add brown and white sugar.
    3. Add the melted chocolate and butter to the egg mixture.
    4. Add the flour and baking powder.
    5. Pour the mixture into a baking tray and bake at 170°C for 30-35 minutes.
    ```

3.  Commit the changes as you have done previously in the workshop. Then go to the neighbour's
    repository's history to see the changes you have made.
