## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Add a cookie recipe to the repository {#sec-add-recipe-file}

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Let's add the first recipe to your repository: A cookie recipe! :cookie:

First, we want to add a file that will include the recipe to the
repository.

1.  Go to the repository on GitHub.
2.  In the code tab, click "Add file" and then "Create new file".
3.  In the "Name your file..." field, type a name for your file. Let's
    call it "cooke-recipe.md". Remember the ".md" file extension so we
    create a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
    file.
4.  Click the green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit
    message. For example, "Add file with cooke recipe". You don't need
    to fill in the extended description. Keep the "Commit directly to
    the `main` branch" option selected.
5.  When you have filled in the commit message, click the green "Commit
    changes" button.
6.  Go back to the repository and check that your file has been added.

You have now added your first recipe and made your first commit to your
repository! :tada:

## :technologist: Exercise: Add the cookie recipe to `cookie-recipe.md` file {#sec-add-recipe-content}

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now that we have created the `cookie-recipe.md` file, let's modify it by
adding the recipe to it:

1.  Go to the file `cookie-recipe.md` in your GitHub repository

2.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") to edit the file.

3.  Make a change to the file by adding a cookie recipe. If you (like
    most of us) don't know a cookie recipe by heart, you can find one
    online, or use the example recipe below (inspired by
    [this](https://twin-food.dk/mit-bud-pa-de-bedste-cookies/) recipe -
    which is really good by the way :yum:):

    ``` markdown
    # Chocolate chip cookies

    ## Ingredients

    - 240 grams flour
    - 3/4 tsp salt
    - 140 grams butter
    - 145 grams brown sugar
    - 115 grams sugar
    - 1 1/2 tsp vanilla powder
    - 1 egg
    - 1/2 tsp baking soda
    - 1 tsp baking powder
    - 150 grams chocolate (e.g., a mix of dark and milk chocolate)
    - 100 grams chopped hazelnuts (can be omitted or replaced with oats)

    ## Instructions

    1. Mix the sugar, brown sugar, and butter well.
    2. Add the egg and mix again.
    3. Add salt, baking powder, vanilla powder, baking soda, and flour.
    4. Add the chopped chocolate and nuts.
    5. Form clumps of dough on a baking tray with plenty of space
        between them.
    6. Bake at 175°C (top and bottom heat) for 16.5-17 minutes.
    7. Once baked, transfer the baking paper with the cookies onto a
        wire rack and let them cool for 10 minutes before removing them
        from the paper.
    ```

4.  Now, commit the changes as you did before by clicking the green
    "Commit changes" button and filling in the commit message (for
    example: "add cookie recipe"). When you have filled in the commit
    message, click the green "Commit changes" button.

5.  Go back to the file on GitHub and check that your changes have been
    made.

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Take a look at the history

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now that we have made a couple of commits to our repositories, let's
take a look at the history of the file:

1.  Go to the `cookie-recipe.md` file and click the "History" button on
    the right side of the screen. This will show you all the changes
    that have been made to the file along with the commit messages.
    Since you have made two commits to the file, you should see two
    entries in the history.
2.  Try clicking on each entry to see the changes that were made in each
    commit.

Looking at the history shows the importance of meaningful commit
messages. Imagine if all the commit messages were "Update file". Then,
it would be easy to lose track of what changes were made in each commit.

By contrast, if the commits have meaningful messages (like "create
recipe file" and "add cookie recipe"), it is much easier to get an
overview of the changes.

## :technologist: Exercise: Rename and move the `cookie-recipe.md` file, then delete it

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Let's imagine that you want to add another cookie recipe (e.g., a peanut
butter cookie recipe) to your recipe book. Because you know that you
would like to add other recipes in the future, you decide to create a
folder for the cookie recipes. Then, it would make sense to rename the
`cookie-recipe.md` file and move it to a new folder called `cookies`.

Let's start by renaming the `cookie-recipe.md` file:

1.  Go to the file on GitHub.
2.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") to edit the file.
3.  Now, click the name of the file at the top of the screen. Rename the
    file to `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Remember to avoid spaces in the
    file name and keep the file extension (`.md`).
4.  Commit the changes as we have done it previously, by clicking the
    green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit message.
5.  Go back to the file on GitHub and see that your changes have been
    made.

Now, let's move the file to a new `cookies` folder in the repository:

1.  Go to the file.
2.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") as we did before.
3.  Click the name of the file at the top of the screen. Change the path
    of the file to a new location in the repository. The current path is
    `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. To create a new folder, change the path
    to `cookies/chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Notice the `/` between the
    folder name and the file name.
4.  Commit the changes.

You have now renamed your recipe file and moved it to a new folder in
the repository! :partying_face:

## :technologist: Exercise: Create an issue with a list of future recipes for your book

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now that you have added a recipe to the repository, let's create a
GitHub Issue to keep track of the recipes you want to add to your recipe
book in the future.

1.  In the repository on GitHub, click the "Issues" tab.
2.  Click the green "New issue" button.
3.  Fill in the title and the description. For example, you could write
    "List of future recipes" as the title and "I want to add the
    following recipes to the recipe book:
    -   Pancakes
    -   Apple pie" as the description.
4.  Click the green "Create" button, to create the issue.

Now, you have created your first issue! :tada:

{{< text_snippet sticky_up >}}

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe suggestion to another's issue

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Since one of the nice things about GitHub is that it allows for easy
collaboration, let's interact with another's issue by adding a recipe
suggestion to it. With your neighbour:

1.  Go to each other's GitHub repositories.
2.  Go to the "Issues" tab in the repository.
3.  Click on the issue that they have created with the list of future
    recipes.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a comment in the
    comment field suggesting a recipe that they could add to their
    recipe book. For example, you could suggest them to add a brownie
    recipe as well :cake:.
5.  When you have written your comment, click the green "Comment" button
    to post the comment.

## :technologist: Exercise: Add a recipe to another's repository :cake:

> Time: \~10 minutes.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Instructor note

Before starting this exercise, make sure that the learners have added
their neighbour as collaborators to their repositories. If they haven't,
they can do so by going to the repository, clicking on "Settings", then
"Collaborators and teams", and then "Add people".
:::

Now, let's add a recipe to your neighbour's repository.

1.  Go to your neighbour's GitHub repository.

2.  As we did in @sec-add-recipe-file and @sec-add-recipe-content , add
    a new file with a recipe - this time, it's just in another person's
    repository. For example, you could add a brownie recipe like the one
    below:

    ``` markdown
    # Brownies

    ## Ingredients 

    - 350 grams dark chocolate
    - 250 grams butter
    - 4 eggs
    - 150 grams brown sugar
    - 150 grams white sugar
    - 60 grams flour
    - 1 tsp baking powder

    ## Instructions

    1. Melt the chocolate and butter together.
    2. Whisk the eggs until frothy and add brown and white sugar.
    3. Add the melted chocolate and butter to the egg mixture.
    4. Add the flour and baking powder.
    5. Pour the mixture into a baking tray and bake at 170°C for 30-35 minutes.
    ```

3.  Commit the changes as we have done it previously and go to the
    repository's history to see the changes you have made.

{{< text_snippet sticky_up >}}

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: See the changes in the repository

> Time: \~10 minutes.

After you have made the changes, go back to the repository and click the
History button to see the changes that have been made (including your
own and the changes made by others).

{{< text_snippet sticky_up >}}

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Cleaning up

> Time: \~10 minutes.

Now, let's close the "Future recipes" issue you created earlier.

1.  Go to the "Issues" tab in your repository.
2.  Click on the issue you created.
3.  In the comment field, write a comment about why you are closing the
    issue. For example, you could write "This issue has been resolved"
    or "I have now added all the relevant recipes from this issue".
    Then, click the "Close issue" button.

Lastly, let's delete the `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` file along with the
`cookies` folder you created earlier:

1.  Go to the file.
2.  On the same line as the file name, click the button with the three
    dots, saying "More file actions". Click it, scroll down and click
    "Delete file".
3.  Commit the changes.
4.  Now, go the `cookies` folder and delete it in the same way as you
    deleted the `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` file. For folders, it will
    say "Delete directory" instead of "Delete file".
