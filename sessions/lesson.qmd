## Exercise: Add a new file and modify the content

First, we want to add a file to the repository.

1.  Go to the repository on GitHub.
2.  In the code tab, click "Add file" and then "Create new file".
3.  In the "Name your file..." field, type a name for your file. For
    simplicity, let's call it your name and make it a Markdown file. For
    example, "your-name.md".
4.  Click the green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit
    message. For example, "Add file with my name". You don't need to
    fill in the extended description. Keep the "Commit directly to the
    `main` branch" option selected.
5.  When you have filled in the commit message, click the green "Commit
    changes" button.
6.  Go back to the repository and check that your file has been added.

You have now made your first commit to the repository! :tada:

Now that we have created a file, let's modify it:

1.  Go to the file on GitHub
2.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") to edit the file
3.  Make a change to the file by adding a new line of text. For example,
    "This is a new line of text."
4.  Now, commit the changes as you did before by clicking the green
    "Commit changes" button and filling in the commit message. When you
    have filled in the commit message, click the green "Commit changes"
    button.
5.  Go back to the file on GitHub and check that your changes have been
    made.

## See the history of changes

If you want to see the history of changes to the file, go to the file
and click the "History" button on the right side of the screen. This
will show you all the changes that have been made to the file along with
the commit messages.

Since you have made two commits to the file, you should see two entries
in the history. You can click on each entry to see the changes that were
made in that commit.

This also shows the importance of meaningful commit messages. Imagine if
all the commit messages were "Update file.md". Then, it would be hard to
know what changes were made in each commit. By contrast, if the commits
have meaningful messages, it would be much more easy to get an overview
of the changes that have been made.

## Exercise: Rename and move your file

Now it's time to make edits to the file itself. We want to rename the
file and move it to a new location in the repository.

1.  Go to the file on GitHub.
2.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") to edit the file.
3.  Now, click the name of the file at the top of the screen. After the
    current name of the file, add "-new-filename". For example, if the
    current name of the file is "file.txt", change it to
    "file-new-filename.txt". Remember to keep the file extension (e.g.,
    ".txt") the same.
4.  Commit the changes as we have done it previously, by clicking the
    green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit message.
5.  Go back to the file on GitHub and check that your changes have been
    made.

## Exercise: Create an issue and interact with another's issue

Let's create your first issue!

1.  In the repository on GitHub, click the "Issues" tab.
2.  Click the green "New issue" button.
3.  Fill in the title and the description. This could be anything you
    want to work on or discuss. For example, it could be about something
    you think should be added (a new file or a new section to a file) or
    something you think should be changed. It could also be a discussion
    issue where you ask for feedback on something.
4.  Click the green "Create" button, to create the issue.

Now, you have created your first issue! :partying_face:

Now, let's interact with another's issue:

1.  Go back to the "Issues" tab in the repository.
2.  Click on an issue that someone else has created.
3.  Read the issue and the comments that have been made.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a comment in the
    comment field. You can ask a question, give feedback, or suggest a
    solution to the issue.
5.  When you have written your comment, click the green "Comment" button
    to post the comment.

## Exercise: Close your issue

Now, let's close the issue you created earlier.

1.  Go to the "Issues" tab in the repository.
2.  Click on the issue you created.
3.  In the comment field, write a comment about why you are closing the
    issue. For example, you could write "This issue has been resolved"
    or "This issue is no longer relevant". Then, click the "Close issue"
    button.
