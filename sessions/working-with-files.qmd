## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Add a cookie recipe to your repository

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Let's add the first recipe to your repository: A cookie recipe! :cookie:

1.  In the "Code" tab of your repository, click the "Add file" button
    and then "Create new file".
2.  In the "Name your file..." field, type the name of your file. Let's
    call it `cooke-recipe.md`. Remember to not use spaces in the file
    name as well as the `.md` file extension so you create a
    [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
    file.
3.  Add a cookie recipe to the file by either finding one online or
    using the example recipe below.
4.  Click the green "Commit changes" button and write a descriptive
    commit message like "Add cookie recipe". You don't need to write an
    extended description. Keep the "Commit directly to the `main`
    branch" option selected.
5.  When you have filled in the commit message, click the green "Commit
    changes" button.

**Example cookie recipe:**

``` markdown

Instructions

1. Mix the sugar, brown sugar, and butter well.
2. Add the egg and mix again.
3. Add salt, baking powder, vanilla powder, baking soda, and flour.
4. Add the chopped chocolate and nuts.
5. Form clumps of dough on a baking tray with plenty of space between them.
6. Bake at 175Â°C (top and bottom heat) for 16.5-17 minutes.

You have now added your first recipe and made your first commit to your
repository! :tada:

## :technologist: Exercise: Rename and move the `cookie-recipe.md` file

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Just like we did with the soup recipe above, let's rename the
`cookie-recipe.md` file so the name is more specific. Let's also move it
to a new baked goods folder. That way, if you want to add other recipes
for baked goods, you can put it in that folder.

While you can move and rename in the same step, for practice, rename the
file first before moving it to the new folder: Start by renaming the
`cookie-recipe.md` file:

1.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") to edit the `cookie-recipe.md` file.
2.  Click the name of the file at the top of the screen and rename the
    file to `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Remember to not use spaces in
    the file name and keep the file extension (`.md`).
3.  Commit the changes as we have done it previously, by clicking the
    green "Commit changes" button and fill in the commit message.

Next, move the file to a new `baked-goods/` folder:

1.  Click the pencil icon on the right side of the screen ("Edit this
    file") as we did before on the `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` file.
2.  Click the name of the file at the top of the screen and change the
    path of the file to a new folder to your repository. The current
    file path is `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. To create a new folder,
    change the file path by typing `baked-goods/` at the start of the
    file name, so the whole file path
    becomes`baked-goods/chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Notice the `/`
    between the folder name and the file name.
3.  Commit the changes.

You have now renamed your cookies recipe file and moved it to a new
folder in your repository! :partying_face:

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Find the commit where you added the cookie recipe

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Now that you have made a couple of commits to your repository, take a
look at the history to find the commit where you first added the cookie
recipe.

1.  In your repository, click the "Commits" button on the right side of
    the screen. This will show you all the changes that have been made
    to your repository along with the commit messages, the author of the
    changes, and when the changes where made. Neat!
2.  Go through the list of commits to find the commit where you added
    the cookie recipe. The commit message should be "Add cookie recipe".

::: callout-note
Looking at the history shows the importance of meaningful commit
messages. Imagine if all the commit messages were "Update file". Then,
it would be easy to lose track of what changes were made in each commit.

By contrast, if the commits have meaningful messages (like "Add cookie
recipe" or "Move cookie recipe to baked-goods folder"), it is much
easier to get an overview of the changes.

::: callout-tip
You can both look at the history of the entire repository or the history
of a specific file. The history of the entire repository shows all the
commits that have been made to all files in the repository, while the
history of a specific file shows the commits that have been made to that
file only.

You can access the history of a specific file by going to the file in
the repository and clicking the "History" button on the right side of
the screen.
