## :book: Reading task: Naming of files and folders

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Emphasise mainly not to use spaces in file names and *why*, not to use
special characters and *why*, and to remember file extensions and *why*.

You can show an example of why spaces aren't good by going to your
browser and typing in a URL with a space in it, e.g., `google.com/ search`.
:::

**Time: \~5 minutes.**

Before we start adding files and folders to our repositories, let's take
a moment to talk about good naming practices for files and folders.

When working with files and folders in a repository---and in
general---it's important to think about how you name them. Good naming
practices can help you and others understand the content of a file or
folder and make it easier to find what you are looking for.

Avoiding certain characters can also help prevent issues when working
with files across different operating systems (like Windows, Mac, and
Linux).

Here are some tips for good naming practices:

-   **Use descriptive names**: Choose names that describe the content of
    the file or folder. For example, instead of naming a file
    `file1.md`, name it `data-analysis-results.md`.
-   **Use lowercase letters**: Filenames are case-sensitive on some
    operating systems, so it is a good practice to always use lowercase
    letters when naming files and folders to avoid confusion.
-   **Use hyphens or underscores**: If you need to separate words in a
    filename, use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) instead of spaces.
    For example, instead of `data analysis results.md`, name your file
    `data-analysis-results.md` or `data_analysis_results.md`. Spaces can
    introduce issues in some situations and contexts. So, it’s best to
    avoid them altogether.
-   **Avoid special characters**: Some special characters, such as `&`,
    `?`, `#`, and the Danish `æ`, `ø`, `å`, can cause issues in
    filenames, so it's best to avoid using them. If you work in Danish
    and have a file name with `æ`, `ø`, or `å`, you can use the
    non-Danish equivalents (`ae`, `oe`, and `aa`) instead.
-   **Use file extensions**: Remember to include file extensions in your
    file names to indicate the type of file. For example, use `.md` for
    Markdown files (`soup.md`), and `.csv` for CSV files (`budget.csv`).

## Add a soup recipe

Now, it's time to create the first file on GitHub. Let's add a soup
recipe together! :bowl_with_spoon:.

In the "Code" tab of the repository, we'll click the button saying "Add
file" in the top-right side of the page. In the dropdown menu, we'll
click "Create new file".

This leads us to a new page with an empty, unnamed file.

In the "Name your file..." field, in the top-left side of the page,
we'll type the name of our file. Let's follow the good naming practices
we've read about above and call it `soup.md`.

For the content of the file, we'll copy and paste the following recipe:

``` markdown
Ingredients for soup

- 4 tbs butter
- 0.5 large onion, cut into large wedges
- 1 can of tomatoes
- 1.5 cups water, vegetable or chicken stock
- 0.5 tsp salt, or more to taste

Instructions

1. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large saucepan.
2. Add onion wedges, water, tomatoes with their juices, and salt.
3. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally.
4. Blend the soup, and season to taste.
```

Once we have added the file name and the recipe itself, let's save the
changes. {{< var github-commit >}}

::: callout-tip
A descriptive message for these changes could be "Create soup recipe md
file"
:::

::: callout-note
You might have noticed that GitHub automatically creates a commit
message for you. Remember that you can edit this message to make it more
descriptive. It's a good practice to edit it to be more descriptive, as
it helps you and others understand the changes that were made to the
repository. Otherwise, you might end up with a commit history that is
"Update file", "Update file", "Update file", etc. :grimacing:
:::

We've now added our first recipe to the repository! :tada: Now, you'll
practice creating files in your repository by adding another recipe.

## :woman_technologist: Exercise: Add a cookie recipe to your repository

**Time: \~10 minutes**

In this exercise, you'll add the second recipe to your `recipes`
repository: A cookie recipe! :cookie:

1.  As we did with the soup recipe before: In the "Code" tab of your
    repository, click the "Add file" button and then "Create new file".
2.  In the "Name your file..." field, type the name of your file. Let's
    call it `cookies.md`. Remember to not use spaces in the file name as
    well as to add the `.md` file extension so you create a
    [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
    file.
3.  Add a cookie recipe to the file by either finding one online or
    using the example recipe below.
4.  Now, save the changes. {{< var github-commit >}}

::: callout-tip
A descriptive message for these changes could be "Add cookie recipe"
:::

**Example cookie recipe:**

``` markdown
Ingredients for cookies

- 240 grams flour
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 140 grams butter
- 145 grams brown sugar
- 115 grams sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla powder
- 1 egg
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 150 grams chocolate (e.g., a mix of dark and milk chocolate)
- 100 grams chopped hazelnuts (can be omitted or replaced with oats)

Instructions

1. Mix the sugar, brown sugar, and butter well.
2. Add the egg and mix again.
3. Add salt, baking powder, vanilla powder, baking soda, and flour.
4. Add the chopped chocolate and nuts.
5. Form clumps of dough on a baking tray with plenty of space between them.
6. Bake at 175°C (top and bottom heat) for 16.5-17 minutes.
7. Once baked, transfer the baking paper with the cookies onto a wire rack
   and let them cool for 10 minutes before removing them from the paper.
```

You have now added your second recipe and made another commit to your
repository! :tada:

## Edit, rename, and move the soup recipe to a new folder

Now, we'll take a look at how to edit, rename, and move files in
repositories on GitHub.

Let's imagine that we want to add more recipes to the repository in the
future. To keep things organised, we want our recipes to have
descriptive names and content. We also want to create some folders to
group similar recipes together.

Let's start by doing this with the soup recipe.

### Edit the content of `soup.md` {.unnumbered}

When we added the content of the file, you might have noticed that it
said "Ingredients for soup" on the first line. This is a bit generic, so
let's change it.

Like before, we'll click the `soup.md` file in the "Code" tab of the
repository to open it and click the pencil icon {{< var pencil-icon >}}
on the top-right side of the page.

Now, let's revise the first line of the file to be "Ingredients for
tomato soup". Once we've made the changes, let's commit them.
{{< var github-commit >}}

::: callout-tip
A descriptive commit message for these changes could be "Add 'tomato' to
the heading of the soup recipe".
:::

### Rename `soup.md` {.unnumbered}

Let's start by renaming the `soup.md` file. We'll go to the `soup.md`
file in the repository by clicking on it in the "Code" tab. Then, we'll
click the pencil icon {{< var pencil-icon >}} on the top-right side of
the page to edit the file.

On the top-left side of the page, we'll see the name of the file. Let's
click on the name and rename the file to `tomato-soup.md`. Remember to
keep the `.md` file extension.

Once we have renamed the file, let's commit the changes.
{{< var github-commit >}}

::: callout-tip
A descriptive commit message for these changes could be "Rename soup.md
to tomato-soup.md".
:::

### Move `tomato-soup.md` to a new `soups/` folder {.unnumbered}

Next, let's move the `tomato-soup.md` file to a new `soups/` folder.

As before, we'll click the `tomato-soup.md` file to open it and click
the pencil icon {{< var pencil-icon >}} on the top-right side of the
page.

Now, let's change the path of the file to a new folder in the
repository, by adding `soups/` before the file name like so:
`soups/tomato-soup.md`. Remember to use `/` between the folder name and
the file name.

This will create a new folder in your `recipes` repository called
`soups/` and then move the `tomato-soup.md` file into it.

::: callout-tip
### Fixing a folder name after typing slash `/`

You might have noticed that once we add the slash `/` after the folder
name, GitHub moves the cursor to the end of the file path, to the file
name. This might make it seem like we can't go back to the folder name
and correct it if we make a typo or want to change it.

However, we can use the backspace key to remove the `/` which leads the
cursor back to the folder name. Now, we can change the folder name as we
like :partying_face:
:::

{{< var github-commit >}}

::: callout-tip
A descriptive message for these changes could be "Move tomato soup
recipe into a new soups folder".
:::

We have now renamed the soup recipe file, edited its content, and moved
it to a new folder in your repository! You can see the new folder
`soups/` in the `Code` tab of your repository and even click on it to
see the `tomato-soup.md` file. :bowl_with_spoon: :tomato:

::: callout-note
### Editing, renaming and moving files can be done in the same step

It is possible to edit, rename, and move files in the same step if you
want to. However, for practice and clarity in the history, we've split
these changes into separate steps.
:::

## :technologist: Exercise: edit, rename, and move the `cookies.md` file

**Time: \~10 minutes**

Just like we did with the soup recipe above, let's rename the
`cookies.md` file so the name is more specific. Let's also move it to a
new `baked-goods/` folder. That way, if you want to add other recipes
for baked goods, you can put it in that folder.

While you can do these changes in one step, for practice, rename the
file first, then edit the content, and last move it to the new folder.

Start by renaming the `cookies.md` file:

1.  Click the pencil icon {{< var pencil-icon >}} on the top-right side
    of the page ("Edit this file") to edit the `cookies.md` file.
2.  Click the name of the file at the top-left of the page and rename
    the file to `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Remember to not use spaces
    in the file name and to keep the file extension (`.md`).
3.  {{< var github-commit >}} Here, a descriptive message could be
    "Rename cookie recipe to chocolate chip cookies".

Edit the `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` file by changing the first line:

1.  Click the pencil icon {{< var pencil-icon >}} on top-right side of
    the page ("Edit this file") to edit the file.
2.  Edit the first line of the file by adding "chocolate chip", so it
    becomes "Ingredients for chocolate chip cookies".
3.  {{< var github-commit >}} Here, a descriptive message could be "Edit
    heading to specify that this is a chocolate chip cookie recipe".

Next, move the file to a new `baked-goods/` folder:

1.  Click the pencil icon {{< var pencil-icon >}} on the top-right side
    of the page ("Edit this file") as we did before on the
    `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` file.
2.  Click the name of the file at the top-left of the page and change
    the path of the file to a new folder in your repository. The current
    file path is `chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. To create a new folder,
    change the file path by typing `baked-goods/` at the beginning of
    the file name, so the path becomes
    `baked-goods/chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Notice the `/` between the
    folder name and the file name.
3.  {{< var github-commit >}} Here, a descriptive message could be "Move
    cookie recipe to baked-goods folder".

You have now renamed your cookies recipe file and moved it to a new
folder in your repository! :partying_face:

## Upload files to a GitHub repository

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## :teacher: Teacher note

Briefly go through the process of uploading files to a GitHub
repository, showing the actual uploading process.

Make sure to mention that this is not a type-along. The learnes will
find an image to upload and upload it the upcoming exercise.
:::

Until now, we've been adding files and folders to the repository by
creating them directly on GitHub. This is a great way to add files and
folders when we want to create new content or edit existing content
directly on GitHub. But, what if we have files on our computer that we
want to add to the repository? Then, we need to *upload* them.

Uploading files to a GitHub repository is a bit different from adding
files and folders. When we upload files, we can select files from our
computer and upload them directly to the repository.

To upload files to a GitHub repository, we'll go to the "Code" tab of
the repository and click the "Add file" button on the top-right side of
the page. In the dropdown menu, we'll click "Upload files". This leads
us to a new page where we can drag and drop files from our computer or
click the "choose your files" button to select files from our computer.
Once we've selected the files we want to upload, we can add a commit
message and commit the changes. This will upload the files to the
repository and create a new commit with the changes.

## :technologist: Exercise: Upload a file to your repository

**Time: \~10 minutes.**

Now, it's your turn to upload a file to your repository. Find an image
of a cookie or recipe book from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) (or
similar website), download it to your computer, and then upload the
image to your repository.

Once you have decided on a file to upload and downloaded it to your
computer, follow these steps:

1.  In the "Code" tab of your repository, click the "Add file" button
    and then "Upload files".
2.  Drag and drop the file you want to upload into the upload area or
    click the "choose your files" button to select the file from your
    computer.
3.  Once you've selected the file, add a commit message to describe the
    changes as you've done before.
4.  Click the "Commit changes..." button to upload the file to your
    repository.

{{< text_snippet sticky_up >}}

## Explore the history to find previous changes

Now that we've made several changes, let's look at the repository's
history. This shows what changes were made, who made them, and when they
were made. This is very useful for tracking progress or finding specific
changes. On GitHub, we can see the history of the entire repository or
the history of a specific file.

Because we've only made a few changes to the repository, let's explore
the history of the entire repository to locate the commit where we first
added the cookie recipe.

In the "Code" tab of the repository, click the "{{< var history-icon >}}
Commits" button on the top-right side of the page. This leads us to a
page that shows all the changes that have been made to the repository
along with the commit messages, the author of the changes, and when the
changes where made. Neat!

Now, we'll go through the list of commits to find the commit where we
added the cookie recipe. The commit message should be something like
"Add cookie recipe". Notice where you can see the author of the commit
and when the commit was made.

Let's click on the commit message to see what was changed in that
commit. Take a moment to explore the information that GitHub provides
about the commit. On the left side of the page, we can see which files
were changed in the commit, and on the right side, we can see the
specific changes that were made to the file. In the top-left corner of
the page, we can still see who made the changes and when they committed
these changes. We can also see that this shows us the version of the
file where the heading hadn't been changed yet. This is how we can look
at what the file looked like at that point in time.

If we want to go back to the list of commits, we can use our browser to
go back to the previous page. For most browsers, this can be achieved by
clicking the left-facing arrow in the top-left corner of the browser.

To see what editing a line within a file looks like, we can click on the
commit message where we edited the heading of the cookie recipe. This
will show us the changes that were made in that commit. The edited line
is shown two times: the old line (in red with a minus in front of it)
and the new line (in green with a plus).

::: callout-note
### Importance of meaningful commit messages

When we explore the history of the repository, it will (hopefully)
highlight the importance of writing meaningful commit messages. Imagine
if all the commit messages were "Update file". Then, it would be quite
cumbersome to find the change we were looking for.

By contrast, if the commits have meaningful messages (like "Add cookie
recipe" or "Move cookie recipe to baked-goods folder"), it is much
easier to get an overview of the changes and locate the one we're
looking for.
:::

::: callout-tip
### History of a specific file

As mentioned above, it's possible to both explore the history of the
entire repository and the history of a specific file. The history of the
entire repository shows all the commits that have been made to all files
in the repository, while the history of a specific file shows the
commits that have been made to that file only.

You can access the history of a specific file by going to the file in
the repository and clicking the "History" button on the top-right side
of the page.
:::

::: callout-tip
### Looking at the entire repository at a specific point in time

It can also be useful to look at the entire repository at a specific
point in time. This can be done by clicking the "Browse files" button on
the top-right side of the page when you've clicked on a specific commit
message. This will show you all files in the repository as they were at
that point in time :alarm_clock:
:::

## Summary

In this session, we have explored how to work with files on GitHub. In
particular, we have:

-   Added files and folders to a GitHub repository
-   Renamed, edited, and moved files in the repository
-   Uploaded a local file to the repository
-   Explored the history of the repository to see the changes and locate
    specific changes
