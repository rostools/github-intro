## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Recall what you read during the pre-tutorial tasks

**Time: \~5 Minutes**

Before we start the tutorial, we'll take some time to "prime" your
memory and activate your prior learning of what you read during the
pre-tutorial tasks. Then after this activity, you'll again read the
description of Git and GitHub from pre-tutorial tasks. We do this
because effective learning is about retrieval, repetition, and actively
engaging in the material. So:

1.  For 1 minute, recall what you understood about Git and GitHub from
    the pre-tutorial tasks. Think about how you'd explain it to someone
    else.
2.  For 4 minutes, pair up with your neighbour and take turns explaining
    to them what you remember, 2 minutes each.
