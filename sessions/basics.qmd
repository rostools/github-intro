## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Recall what you read during the pre-workshop tasks

**Time: \~5 Minutes**

Before we start the workshop, we'll take some time to "prime" your
memory and activate your prior learning of what you read during the
pre-workshop tasks. Then after this activity, you'll again read the
description of Git and GitHub from pre-workshop tasks. We do this
because effective learning is about retrieval, repetition, and actively
engaging in the material. So:

1.  For 1 minute, recall what you understood about Git and GitHub from
    the pre-workshop tasks. Think about how you'd explain it to someone
    else.
2.  For 4 minutes, pair up with your neighbour and take turns explaining
    to them what you remember, 2 minutes each.

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Explain the basics of Git

**Time: \~4 minutes.**

Learning is about recalling and explaining something in your own words.
And since Git is such a fundamentally different way of working with and
thinking about files, this discussion activity aims to help solidify
what we've covered so far about Git. So:

1.  Take \~1 minute to silently explain to yourself what you understood
    the basics of Git are.
2.  Pair up with your neighbour and for the next 3 minutes, take turns
    (1.5 minutes each) explaining to each other what you understand
    about the basics of Git. Try to come to a shared understanding of
    what it is, how to work with it, and how it's different from other ways of working with files.
