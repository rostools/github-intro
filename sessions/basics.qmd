## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Recall what you read during the pre-workshop tasks

**Time: \~5 Minutes**

Before we start the workshop, we'll take some time to "prime" your
memory and activate your prior learning of what you read during the
pre-workshop tasks. Then after this activity, you'll again read the
description of Git and GitHub from pre-workshop tasks. We do this
because effective learning is about retrieval, repetition, and actively
engaging in the material. So:

1.  For 1 minute, recall what you understood about Git and GitHub from
    the pre-workshop tasks. Think about how you'd explain it to someone
    else.
2.  For 4 minutes, pair up with your neighbour and take turns explaining
    to them what you remember, 2 minutes each.

## :teacher: Instructor note

After they've read it, take some time to repeat some key points from the
text, such as:

-   Emphasise how people usually version files.
-   Highlight that Git can track any file type, but that Git has more
    features for text-based files.
-   Reinforce what "plain text" files are.

**Time: \~5 minutes.**

This is the same text you read for the pre-workshop tasks. Why are we
getting you to do a discussion activity to remember Git, then getting
you to again re-read the text? We're doing this because we know that
learning and understanding Git is *very hard*, so we're giving you
repeated exposures to it. Git requires you use the computer in such a
fundamentally different way to how people usually work on their
computers, that we've learned that we need to give lots of opportunities
for learners to learn and try to understand what Git does and why to use
it. So having these repeated exposures helps reinforce these concepts.

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Explain the basics of Git

**Time: \~4 minutes.**

Learning is about recalling and explaining something in your own words.
And since Git is such a fundamentally different way of working with and
thinking about files, this discussion activity aims to help solidify
what we've covered so far about Git. So:

1.  Take \~1 minute to silently explain to yourself what you understood
    the basics of Git are.
2.  Pair up with your neighbour and for the next 3 minutes, take turns
    (1.5 minutes each) explaining to each other what you understand
    about the basics of Git. Try to come to a shared understanding of
    what it is, how to work with it, and how it's different from other
    ways of working with files.
