We've reached the end of the workshop! Let's take a look at what we've
covered.

We've now covered the basics of GitHub and Git, working with files on
GitHub, and making and using GitHub Issues.

More specifically, we've:

-   Created a repository on GitHub
-   Worked with files in our own repository on GitHub: Created, edited,
    renamed, and deleted recipe files and folders
-   Created and commented on GitHub issues
-   Added and removed collaborators
-   Worked with files in our collaborator's repository on GitHub

Let's spend a few minutes thinking about how you might use GitHub in
your own work.


## What's next?

We hope you've enjoyed this workshop and that you've learned something
new about GitHub and Git. If you want to learn more about Git and
GitHub, we are working on a series of workshops that will cover more
advanced topics:

1.  Work-in-progress:
    [quarto-website-intro](https://github.com/rostools/quarto-website-intro) -
    Create a website using GitHub and Quarto.
2.  Work-in-progress: [git4cats]() - Work in
    **C**oll**A**borative**T**eam**S** using Git and GitHub.

You can continue learning about Git and GitHub by exploring the [GitHub
Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) where you can learn more about e.g.,
[repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) and [GitHub
Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues).

If you are interested in learning about modern approaches and workflows
in R (that also touch upon Git and GitHub), take loot at our workshop
series [r-cubed: Reproducible Research in
R](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/). As this workshop, the workshop
material is free and open to everyone.

<!-- TODO: Can we add a link to DDEA or somewhere where people can find out when the workshops will be run again? -->
