# Concluding remarks {#sec-conclusion}

<!-- TODO: Add content that mirrors/reflects on the bigger picture from the intro (once that has been made) -->

We've nearly reached the end of the workshop! To summarise, we've
covered the basics of GitHub and Git, working with files on GitHub, and
making and using GitHub Issues.

More specifically, we've:

-   Created a repository on GitHub
-   Worked with files in our own repository on GitHub: Created, edited,
    renamed, and deleted recipe files and folders
-   Created and commented on GitHub issues

Let's spend a few minutes thinking about how you might use GitHub in
your own work.

## :speech_balloon: Discussion activity: Consider how you'd use GitHub in your work

**Time: \~6 minutes.**

To help consolidate what you've learned in this workshop, let's connect
it with what you do in your daily work life. On your own and based on
what we've covered so far, think about how you might use GitHub in your
own work. Then, share some of your ideas with your neighbour.

1.  Take \~1 minute to think how you might use GitHub in your own work.
2.  Then, pair up with your neighbour and take 3 minutes (1.5 minutes
    each) to share your ideas.
3.  After this, we'll come back together and share some of the
    ideas---we might inspire each other!
