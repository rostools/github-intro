## Learning outcome and objectives

The aim of this workshop is to enable you to:

-   Explain in simple terms what GitHub does and navigate
    GitHub to work with files and GitHub Issues.


Broken down into specific objectives within a few sessions, the workshop will enable you to:

-   List and describe Git's core functionality and purpose, and how
    GitHub expands on that.
-   Explain the difference between GitHub and Git.
-   Explain how GitHub differs from services like OneDrive or Dropbox,
    and what GitHub's advantage is over them.
-   Interact with and navigate GitHub to create, edit, rename,
    and delete files and folders.
-   Create GitHub Issues to start discussions, request help,
    or list to-do tasks and comment on existing "Issues".
-   Explain the benefits of using Issues to keep track of discussions and to-do lists within the same platform as
    your files.

Tangibly, during the tutorial we will:

-   Create your own project (also known as a *repository*) on GitHub
-   Create and edit text files on GitHub.
-   Create Issues and comment on them.

## Is this course for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this course, we
make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
course:

-   Assumptions

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in learning R but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend the course*! We welcome
everyone, that is until the course capacity is reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this course is for you.
