## Is this for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this tutorial,
we make a few possible assumptions about *who you are* as a participant
in the tutorial, such as one or more of the following:

-   You want a gentle introduction to what GitHub is and how to use it.
-   You mostly work alone or maybe irregularly with someone else on your
    project.
-   You write text in documents as a main activity of your work.
-   You are able to and are comfortable enough with only working on files
    through a web browser interface (like GitHub's interface).

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in the tutorial but don't fit any of the
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend*! We welcome
everyone, that is until capacity has been reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this course is for you.

-   We will only interact with GitHub from the website and from a web
    browser.
-   We will only write *text*, there will be no code or programming
    used.
-   While we will write in a `.md` Markdown file, we will not write or
    cover Markdown syntax.
-   We will not go over too many details of Git (a software that GitHub
    relies on).
