Our overarching **learning outcome** is that at the end of the tutorial,
participants will be able to:

-   Describe and navigate GitHub's features to modify files and files,
    write text in files, and create or comment on issues.

Our specific **learning objectives** are to:

-   Describe the very basics of the version control software Git,
    specifically by defining repository, committing, and the history.
-   Explain the difference between GitHub and Git, and then describe
    what GitHub can be used for.
-   Describe and navigate to each of GitHub's basic features,
    specifically the "code" page, the "commit history", and "issues".
-   Use GitHub to create, upload, delete, or rename files and folders.
-   Use GitHub to edit content in an existing file.
-   Use GitHub's to create "Issues" to start discussions, request for
    help, or list to-do tasks, as well as to comment on other "Issues".

## Is this course for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this course, we
make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
course:

-   Assumptions

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in learning R but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend the course*! We welcome
everyone, that is until the course capacity is reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this course is for you.
