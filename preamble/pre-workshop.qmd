# Pre-workshop tasks {#sec-pre-workshop}

In order to participate in this workshop, you must complete everything
in this section and finish with **completing the
[survey](@sec-pre-workshop-survey)** at the end. These tasks are
designed to make it easier for everyone to start the workshop with
everything set up.

Depending on your skills and knowledge, these tasks could take between
**1-2 hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning some time to complete
them. While many of the tasks are mostly readings, they are important in
making sure you get the most out of the workshop.

## Summary of tasks

Here's a quick overview of the tasks you need to do. Specific details
about them are found as you work through the tasks.

1.  Read the syllabus (@sec-syllabus).
2.  Read the [Code of
    Conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html).
3.  Read the primer on version control, Git, and GitHub
    (@sec-intro-to-github).
4.  Create a GitHub user account (@sec-github-user).
5.  Complete the pre-workshop survey (@sec-pre-workshop-survey): This
    survey is pretty quick, maybe \~10 minutes. Note that you will be
    asked to add your GitHub username to the survey.

## :book: Introduction to version control, Git, and GitHub {#sec-intro-to-github}

This reading is meant as a primer to the workshop. It will introduce you
to the concepts of *version control*, *Git*, and *GitHub*.

### What is version control and Git? {#sec-what-is-version-control}

### What is GitHub then? {#sec-what-is-git-and-github}

There are several ways to use Git. In this workshop, we will use
[GitHub](https://github.com/), which is a website that hosts projects
that uses Git (meaning, Git repositories). This means that your Git
repositories can be stored on GitHub, and you can manage your files and
projects using Git through GitHub's web interface.

Everything we do in this workshop (including storing and managing files)
will be done through the GitHub website, which under the hood uses Git
to track the changes. Nice!

### Summary of Git and GitHub

-   Using a *formal version control* system like Git can help you keep
    track of changes to your files and projects.
-   A Git *repository* is a place where you store all the files for your
    project along with their history.
-   GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories.
-   Through GitHub you can manage your files and projects using Git.

<!-- TODO: Move the definition list below to a glossary repo? -->

So far, we have encountered the following terminology:

| Term | Definition |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Version control** | The practice of tracking changes to files over time. |
| **Git** | A widely popular version control system that tracks changes to files and projects. |
| **(Git) Repository** | A "project" with files that are stored and tracked by Git. |
| **Commit** | A snapshot of changes made to file(s) in a repository. |
| **GitHub** | A website that hosts Git repositories. |

## :woman_technologist: Create a GitHub account {#sec-github-user}

To participate in the workshop, you will need a GitHub account. Please
go to the [GitHub website](github.com) and create an account. Remember
your username, as you will need it for the survey at the end of this
section.

::: callout-note
If you already have one, you can skip this task, but we will still ask
you to provide your username in the survey at the end of this section.
:::

Whenever events or activities related to you happen on GitHub, you will
receive a notification. By default, the notification sends to both your
GitHub "inbox" (which we cover later) and your email. Unfortunately,
there can quickly become a lot of activities happening and you will
receive a large volume of email notifications. This can be overwhelming.

You can manage your notifications and prevent your email inbox from
being sent many GitHub notification emails by setting a few options in
your GitHub account settings.

While logged into your new GitHub account, click on your account icon in
the top-right corner of GitHub and select the "Settings" option. In the
left sidebar, select "Notifications". Under "Subscriptions", select
"Notify me: on GitHub" and for all options. In the "System" section,
under "Actions", deselect all options and click "Save". This will show
up as "Don't notify". If you want some notifications sent to your email,
you can always come back and change these settings later.

With these options selected, you will only get notifications on GitHub,
not by email.

## Pre-workshop survey {#sec-pre-workshop-survey}

If you haven't read the syllabus (@sec-syllabus) and the primer on
version control and GitHub above (@sec-intro-to-github), **please read
it now**.

Also make sure to read the [Code of
Conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html), since the survey
involves a question about it. We want to make sure this workshop is a
supportive and safe environment for learning, so this Code of Conduct is
quite important.

You're almost done. Please fill out the pre-workshop survey to finish
this section, either [at this link]().

See you at the workshop!
