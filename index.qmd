# Welcome!

This 3-hour workshop is a gentle introduction to using GitHub for
managing and working with files. It is designed for doing participatory
live-typing, where the instructor demonstrates the tasks on their
computer connected to a projector while learners type along on their own
computer. The workshop also includes reading tasks, discussion
activities, and hands-on exercises.

This website contains all of the material for the workshop, including
readings, exercises, presentations, live-typing material, and images. It
is structured as a book, with "chapters" as sessions, in order of
appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the course where
"type-along" sessions almost identically follow the material on the
website (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the course, both to follow along
    in case they get lost and also to use as a reference after the
    workshop ends. A more detailed description of who the learner is can
    be found in @sec-is-it-for-you.
2.  For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the
    type-along sessions and lectures.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and instructing their own workshops.
