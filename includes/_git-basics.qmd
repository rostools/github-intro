In our work lives, we regularly work with files, either creating,
modifying, moving, copying, or deleting them. These files can be
anything from text documents, to images, to code. When we work on these
files, we often make changes to them, and sometimes many changes. We
might want to keep track of these changes, so we can see *what* we've
done, *when* we did it, and *why* we did it. This is both helpful for
potential collaborators and our future selves.

If the file has the ability to internally "track changes", like Word
does, you may have used that before, but likely only when getting
feedback from others. On the file level, you may have "tracked changes"
informally by saving multiple versions of a file with different names,
like in the example image below.

control'.](/images/informal-version-control.jpg)

Does this way of saving files and keeping track of versions look
familiar? The above image may exaggerate how people's versioning looks
like, there is some truth to it: It is the most common approach to
"version control".

This "informal" version control isn't ideal because it involves multiple
copies of the same file. It makes it difficult to keep track of specific
changes and find the right version of our files.

There are, however, "formal" version control systems that automatically
manage changes to files. One of the world's most popular version control
system is called
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
Git is used by millions of people around the world, including thousands
of organisations and researchers.

Git creates snapshots of file changes, known as *commits*. Each commit
captures:

-   What specific changes were made to the file or files.
-   Who made the changes to the files.
-   When they made the changes to the files.

Each commit also has a short message attached to it, that hopefully
describes *why* the changes were made.

Git stores these commits in a history log. The history log allows you to
quickly go back and review the changes made to the files, along with the
message describing the changes. This is extremely useful when you
revisit your own work after a long time (because you *will* forget
things) and when you work in groups or with collaborators.

Git only tracks changes to files *within a specific folder* (and it's
sub-folders). In Git terminology, this parent folder is called a
**repository** (or a *repo* for short). The best way to use a repository
is to store all files related to a specific project, like a research
project, in this repository (this folder). This way, you can track all
changes to all files in the project. It keeps things more organised and
self-contained, since everything related to a project is in one place.

Any type of file can be stored in the repository, this includes both
code and other non-code based files like Word or images. Though, Git has
more features and tools at tracking specific changes when the file is
text-based, like a `.txt`, `.csv`, or code. Since these text-based files
are literally only text characters, it is easier to track the changes to
exact lines of text. Unlike files like images, or Word documents (that
actually aren't just text), there are no "lines" to track changes on.

To understand how powerful something like Git is, consider about these
questions:

-   How many files of different versions of a scientific document or
    thesis do you have laying around after getting feedback from your
    supervisor or co-authors?
-   Have you ever wanted to test out an analysis with some code in a
    file and end up making a new file so that the original is not
    modified?
-   Have you ever deleted something and wished you hadn't?
-   Have you ever forgotten what you were doing on a project, or why you
    chose a particular strategy or analysis?

All these problems can be fixed by using formal version control! There
are so many good reasons to use version control, especially in science:

-   Transparency of work done to demonstrate or substantiate your
    scientific claim and protect against accusations of fraud.
-   Claim to first discovery, since you have a time-stamped history of
    your work.
-   Evidence of contributions and work, since who does what is tracked.
-   Easier collaboration, because you can work on a single file/folder
    that is in a central location rather than emailing file versions
    around.
-   Organized files and folders, since there is one single project
    folder and one single version of each file, rather than multiple
    versions of the same file.
-   Less time spent on finding things related to your projects, because
    everything is organized and in one place.
