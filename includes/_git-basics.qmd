One of the world's most popular version control systems is called
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git). Git
is used by millions of people around the world, including thousands of
organisations. It is also used increasingly by researchers.

With Git you can create snapshots of file changes, known as *commits*.
Each commit captures:

-   *What* specific changes were made to the file or files.
-   *Who* made the changes to the files.
-   *When* they made the changes to the files.

Each commit also has a short message attached to it that can describe
*why* the changes were made.

Git stores these commits in a history log. The history log allows you to
quickly go back and explore the changes made to files, along with a
message describing the changes. This is extremely useful when you
revisit your own work after a long time and when you work in groups or
with collaborators.

Git only tracks changes to files *within a specific folder* (and its
sub-folders). In Git terminology, this folder is called a **repository**
(or a *repo* for short). The best way to use a repository is to store
all files related to a specific project, like a research project or
administration files for your lab or group, in the repository (the
"folder"). This way, you can track all changes made to all files in the
project. It keeps things more organised and self-contained, since
everything related to a project is in one place.

Any type of file can be stored in a repository, including both text and
other non-text based files like Word or images. However, Git can only
show specific changes made to a file if it is text-based, like a `.txt`,
`.csv`, or code. Since these text-based files are literally only text
characters, it is easier for the computer to show the exact changes to
the exact lines of text. Unlike files like images, or Word documents
(that actually aren't just text), where there are no "lines" to track
changes on.
