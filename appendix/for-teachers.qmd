# For teachers

A more general guide to teaching or helping is found on the
[Guides](https://guides.rostools.org/) website. This page has
information relevant specifically to this workshop.

## Pre-workshop tasks

Before the workshop, you need to do the steps below.

-   Go through the pre-workshop survey to check that all registered
    learners have completed it and have sent their GitHub username.
-   If you have any extensions installed in your browser that could
    alter the way GitHub.com looks (like Refined GitHub), disable them,
    so it will look the same for everyone.
-   If you're teaching the "Working with files" session: Download an
    image that you can use to demonstrate uploading files to a
    repository. E.g., an image of a soup or a cookie from
    [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
-   Make (if not made) the origami hats and bring them to the workshop,
    or alternatively use post-it notes/stickies.
