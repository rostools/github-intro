## Pre-tutorial tasks

Before the tutorial, you need to do the steps below:

-   Make a GitHub organisation for the tutorial (if one doesn't already
    exist)
-   Get the participants' GitHub user names from the pre-tutorial survey
-   Add the participants to the organisation and give them write access
    to all (future) repos
-   Make (if not made) the origami hats and bring them to the tutorial,
    or alternatively use post-it notes/stickies.
