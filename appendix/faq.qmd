## How can I delete files in a GitHub repository?

Working with the files we created during the sessions, let's say you
want to use our repository for recipes of only sweets, desserts, and
baked goods. This means that you will need to remove the tomato soup
recipe from the repository.

To delete the `tomato-soup.md` file, you'd click the `soups/` folder in
the "Code" tab of the repository and then click the `tomato-soup.md`
file within it.

In the top-right corner of the page, you'd click the button with three
dots ({{< var ellipsis-icon >}}), scroll down to the bottom of the
dropdown menu and click "Delete file".

You'd save the changes (the deletion) by committing the changes as
you've done during the workshop.

When looking at the files and folders in the repository now, you might
notice something unexpected: When we deleted the `tomato-soup.md` file,
GitHub automatically deleted the `soups/` folder as well! This is
because the folder only contained that one file. GitHub will
automatically remove empty folders if there is only only file was it and
it was deleted. So, we don't need to delete the `soups/` folder
separately. :fire:

You've now deleted the tomato soup recipe and the `soups/` folder from
the repository and are ready to focus on sweets and baked goods! :cake:

## How can I delete a folder with multiple files?

If you wanted to delete a folder with multiple files in it along with
the files themselves, you can go to the folder and click the three dots
button ({{< var ellipsis-icon >}}) in the top-right corner of the page.
Then, click "Delete directory" in the dropdown menu.

This will delete the folder and all the files within it, so be careful
with deleting folders directly like this.
