## How can I delete files in a GitHub repository?

To delete a file in a repository, you first need to go to the file in
the "Code" tab. This might include clicking on some folders until you
can see the file you want to delete. Once you see it, e.g.,
`tomato-soup.md`, click it. In this view, you can see the contents of the
file.

In the top-right corner of the page, you'll click the button with three
dots ({{< var ellipsis-icon >}}), scroll down to the bottom of the
dropdown menu and click "Delete file".

You then save the changes (the deletion) by committing the changes as
you've done during the workshop.

If you've deleted the only file within a folder, you might notice
something unexpected: When you deleted the file, GitHub automatically
deleted the folder as well! This is because the folder only contained
that one file and GitHub will automatically remove empty folders. So, if
this was the case, you don't have to delete the folder separately :fire:

## How can I delete a folder with multiple files?

If you wanted to delete a folder with multiple files in it along with
the files themselves, you can go to the folder and click the three dots
button ({{< var ellipsis-icon >}}) in the top-right corner of the page.
Then, click "Delete directory" in the dropdown menu.

This will delete the folder and all the files within it, so be careful
with deleting folders directly like this.

## Can I look at the history of all files at a specific point in time?

Yes! It can be useful to look at the entire repository at a specific
point in time. This can be done by clicking the "Browse files" button on
the top-right side of the page when you've clicked on a specific commit
message. This will show you all files in the repository as they were at
that point in time :alarm_clock:

## Can I look at the full history of a specific file?

Yes! It's possible to explore the history of a specific file only. You
can access the history of a specific file by going to the file in the
repository and clicking the "History" button on the top-right side of
the page.
