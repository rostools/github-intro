# Syllabus {#sec-syllabus}

Over the last few decades, the way we do research has substantially
changed as the internet---especially digital technologies and social
media---have become more embedded in even the more traditional and
conservative parts of our society. This shift has affected research in
multiple ways and has increased the need, expectation, and/or pressure
on various aspects. These needs include, in no particular order, being
able to:

1.  Formally disseminate more types of new or existing knowledge and
    scientific output.
2.  Informally share information, discussions, or ideas regularly and
    quickly.
3.  Collaborate more across regions and timezones.
4.  Be more open and transparent about the whole research process.
5.  Network and connect with others in the research community and, at
    least in health, those who participate or want to participate in
    research using a wider variety of tools and platforms.

While academia and research seek to expand the boundaries of our
collective knowledge, we also paradoxically are very slow to adapt to
and adopt changes, especially technological ones. But the needs listed
above are now so great that we must embrace new tools to effectively
fulfil those needs.

This workshop introduces you to one such tool widely used for working
and communicating in industry and increasingly in academia: GitHub.
While GitHub can fulfil the needs above and much more, for this workshop
we will focus on the transparency and sharing aspects, rather than the
collaboration aspects.

This workshop lasts 3 hours and is split into the following sessions,
listed in the [schedule](/overview/schedule.qmd), which will be covered
in order:

-   [Introduction to the workshop](/sessions/introduction.qmd)
-   [The basics of GitHub and Git](/sessions/basics.qmd)
-   [Working with files on GitHub](/sessions/working-with-files.qmd)
-   [Making and using GitHub Issues](/sessions/using-issues.qmd)
-   [Concluding remarks](/sessions/conclusion.qmd)

## Learning outcome and objectives

The overall aim of this workshop is to enable you to:

-   Explain in simple terms what Git and GitHub do, work with files
    and folders on GitHub and track tasks using GitHub Issues.

Broken down into specific objectives for each session, we've designed
the workshop to enable you to do the following:

[**The basics of GitHub and Git**](/sessions/basics.qmd)

{{< include /includes/objectives/_basics.qmd >}}

[**Working with files on GitHub**](/sessions/working-with-files.qmd)

{{< include /includes/objectives/_working-with-files.qmd >}}

[**Making and using GitHub Issues**](/sessions/using-issues.qmd)

{{< include /includes/objectives/_using-issues.qmd >}}

Tangibly, during the workshop you will:

-   Create your own project on GitHub (known as a *repository*)
-   Create and edit text files and folders on GitHub.
-   Create GitHub Issues and comment on them.

We will not go into using GitHub for collaboration as that is beyond the
scope of this workshop.
